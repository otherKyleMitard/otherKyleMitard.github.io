				<p>In 2019, the <a href="https://www.best-selling-cars.com/europe/2019-full-year-europe-best-selling-car-models/">top three best selling cars in Europe</a> were the Volkswagen Golf (a compact hatchback), Renault Clio (a subcompact or “supermini” as they call it), and Volkswagen Polo (also a supermini). <a href="https://www.best-selling-cars.com/japan/2019-full-year-japan-best-selling-car-models/">In Japan,</a> the top three were the Honda N-BOX, Daihatsu Tanto, and Suzuki Spacia, all of which encompass the ultra restrictive Kei car class of minicars, of which the only foreign car to ever meet their standards was a variant of the Smart Fortwo exclusive to Japan. <a href="https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2019-us-vehicle-sales-figures-by-model/">In the USA</a> (not counting trucks due to their heavy commercial use which skews the data), it’s the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and Nissan Rogue, all of which are SUVs, which are significantly larger than the aforementioned hatchbacks. All three of those markets mostly cover <a href=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?type=shaded&view=map&year=2018"">predominantly urban countries</a> where it would make more sense to own a smaller car, and the data makes sense for Europe and Japan, but the United States is a weird exception, and as for why, it all ties back to the history, culture, and economy of America.</p>
				<p>Europe has historically suffered from shortages in fuel, and this is reflected in their auto industry. Many of the more popular cars in Europe were small gas sippers, including the classic Mini and Volkswagen Golf. Also, some city streets were designed centuries before widespread car use and as such are too narrow for any other vehicles. In Japan, characterized by extremely dense cities like Tokyo, they take it a step further by having a “road tax” based on engine displacement, which makes anything with an engine larger than 3 litres a tough sell. The aforementioned Kei cars occupy the lowest tax bracket amongst other incentives. Likewise, both regions have resorted to building smaller performance cars for the masses, with “hot hatchbacks” like the Volkswagen Golf GTI enjoying great success in Europe and Japanese performance cars being characterized by high-revving inline fours and sixes as seen in Honda Integras, Nissan Skylines, and other such cars.</p>
				<p>America is quite different in that not much of the above applies to them. Fuel prices have historically been lower, some areas like Detroit were essentially built around the automobile. In addition, throughout the 1950s and 60s, there was a massive system of interstate highways built which had a great cultural impact on Americans. These driving conditions (which are unfavorable to compact cars when fuel isn’t an issue), alongside a few hints of American excess culture results in a world of massive land yachts like the Chevrolet Bel Air, Lincoln Continental, and Cadillac Eldorado becoming staples of American car culture. In addition, performance cars evolved out of highway pulls and straight-line drag races, with Pontiac GTOs, Ford Mustangs, and Chevrolet Camaros packing massive V8s that displaced upwards of 6 or 7 litres. Much of this trend was reversed with the after effects of the 1973 fuel crisis, but today, with low fuel prices and the greying of America, large cars are becoming the norm again in the form of SUVs. Not to mention the blue-collar cultural ties with pickup trucks.</p>
