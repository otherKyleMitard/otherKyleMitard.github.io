				<h2>2013 Honda Accord V6</h2>
				<h3>So good that it's down to the little things that bug me</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="text-left" style="margin:50px;">
				<p>They say that the closer you get to perfection, the less tolerance you have for small imperfections, and the 2013 Honda Accord V6 is no exception. There is quite a lot to like with the car, yet the natural attraction to negativity makes us concentrate on the issues, thus mostly overshadowing everything else, and this is no different from the current climate of internet news which is seemingly engineered to create outrage. However, I digress, because after all this is a car review, not a sociopolitical commentary.</p>
				<h3>THE GOOD</h3>
				<p>This ninth generation Accord sedan is powered by a 3.5 litre V6 rated at 278 hp and 252 lb-ft of torque mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, which propels the car from 0-60 in 5.6 seconds, which are very healthy numbers for a mid-size sedan, and more than enough for highway merges and perhaps having a bit of fun, provided traction control doesn’t kick in. Manual transmission models with the V6 also exist if you’re into that, but they are extremely hard to find. Handling is very good for a mid-size sedan, although it’s not a sports car. As much as I hate how the word “sporty” is misused to describe things like a Toyota Avalon with an appearance package, it perfectly describes the V6 Accord.</p>
				<p>The interior feels great, with comfortable leather seats, a perfectly normal steering wheel, and plenty of space for five adults. Although it isn’t a luxury car, nothing feels overly cheap, and all of the controls, including but not limited to the climate controls, turn signal and wiper stalks, and infotainment controls all feel right and (with a few exceptions) intuitive and well-built. There is even a super subtle faux wood pattern across the dashboard which is a nice touch. There is a reverse camera, built-in navigation, bluetooth support, heated seats, and power seat controls with two memory settings, each tied to one of the key fobs (when you open the door the seat automatically adjusts to the respective memory setting). Exterior styling is also subtle and elegant, with no egregiously fake vents, spoilers, or exhaust tips.</p>
				<h3>THE BAD</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately the truth is that I struggled to write the above section because the following nitpicks were on my mind instead:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The dead pedal feels like it is positioned unnaturally high for some reason, so I cannot comfortably rest my foot on it, in spite of an otherwise perfect driving position</li>
					<li>The climate control temperature and fan speed is adjusted with buttons instead of dials, so making large adjustments are cumbersome</li>
					<li>I often find myself having to slightly adjust my seating position because I cannot seem to get it just right, and if I forget to reset the seat memory, any progress I make is undone</li>
					<li>The infotainment is unbelievably clunky in 2020, with its limitations and slow to respond touch screen, although it was acceptable in 2013</li>
					<li>When coasting, the car can sometimes downshift which slightly hampers an otherwise smooth ride</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>
				<p>These days, you can find these cars used between $10,000 and $15,000, and it is a very compelling buy that I would totally recommend, in spite of all of my complaints. In fact, much of what I complain about is subjective, and you may not be as horribly offended by those aspects as I was. Nothing is perfect, but if you’re in the market for a mid-size sedan, the 2013 Accord V6 is reasonably close.</p>
