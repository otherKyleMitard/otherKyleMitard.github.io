				<h2>2021 Acura TLX</h2>
				<h4>Very promising but has some major hurdles to overcome</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text-left" style="margin:50px;">
				<p>When I first saw <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28689963/acura-type-s-concept/">Acura’s Type S concept</a> last year I was excited to see that they were promising to not give up on building a low and sleek sports sedan in a world of bloated SUVs, and the newly unveiled <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32687740/2021-acura-tlx-sports-sedan-photos-info/">2021 Acura TLX</a> completely delivers on this promise. The long, low and sleek design is the realization of this concept, and it finally looks like something that can compete with the Audi A4, its most direct competition. It will be offered with a 2.0 litre turbo 4-cylinder producing 278 hp mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission and their Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system, which is a healthy number for competing with the A4. In addition, there is a Type S model to be unveiled next year sporting a 3.0 litre V6 with no official power figures yet, which would go after the Audi S4.</p>
				<p>It all seems promising, but it is still an uphill battle considering the current state of Acura. For one, there’s SH-AWD, which is a strange but impressive system that barely anyone knows much about. Nonetheless, it presents a heavy marketing challenge that cannot be downplayed. You know what system does not have this problem? Audi Quattro: the original AWD system that is very much responsible for building Audi as a brand. In addition, <a href="https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/04/acura-rdx-infotainment-system-how-the-heck-are-you-supposed-to-use-it-.html">Acura’s infotainment system,</a> which seems to be here to stay judging by the pictures, is strange and controversial, characterized by a touchpad with a steep learning curve that can be quite off-putting to many potential buyers, although some say you get used to it while others consider it a dealbreaker.</p>
				<p>Overall, I’d say the 2021 TLX is an extremely promising vehicle and despite my doubts, I would love for Acura to prove me wrong, because Acura should be rewarded for resisting the SUV plague. It will take some effort for this car to succeed, but Acura seems to have the passion to make it happen.</p>
