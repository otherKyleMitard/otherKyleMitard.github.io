				<h2>2020 Porsche Taycan</h2>
				<h4>Porsche's design ethos is the best and worst part</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="text-left" style="margin:50px;">
				<p>When the Taycan was unveiled in fall 2019, all of Elon Musk’s disciples were quick to point out the EV’s shortcomings, which consisted of the car’s range, 0-60 time and cargo capacity all falling short of the Tesla Model S, all for a significantly higher price. All of these statements are valid, and it makes sense why these facts are such a big deal to Tesla fans. These people are not the traditional car enthusiasts, but rather tech enthusiasts, many of whom are used to the numbers game of frames per second, gigabytes of RAM, and milliamp-hours of battery, and while there is significant merit to these numbers (particularly range), there is more to it than that.</p>
				<p>Porsche fans, on the other hand, are more traditional car enthusiasts who put great value in less tangible qualities, particularly handling. In addition, the Taycan’s diminishing returns (perhaps even losses) are very characteristic of Porsche’s lineup. Take, for instance, the Taycan’s gasoline counterpart, the Porsche Panamera. The Panamera Turbo starts at $154,350 and accelerates from 0-60 in 3.0 seconds, which is not necessarily a good deal considering that the BMW M5 has a much lower starting price of $104,695 and a better 0-60 time of 2.8 seconds. However, many still choose to buy the Panamera because it handles better and feels much more premium, and the same idea is at play with the Taycan, especially considering Tesla’s reputation for poor quality control, as they are very new to manufacturing cars. This is how Porsche has always run. In addition, they have put considerable effort into making sure the Taycan can take the abuse of a racetrack, on which Teslas are notorious for overheating, often struggling to complete a whole lap, which is not much different from when in <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/reviews/a6921/2014-porsche-911-turbo-s-65-7-roa0314/">2014 Porsche engineers boasted the new at the time 911 Turbo S’s ability to withstand repeated use of launch control without damaging transmission and drivetrain components,</a> which would result in other manufacturers to severely limit its use. The design trade-offs that went into the Taycan are typical of most Porsches.</p>
				<p>With that said, does the general public even care? Track days are too costly, risky, and infrequent for the vast majority of the population to take advantage of such features, and the handling only appeals to a niche group of car enthusiasts, so what is of practical use? The Taycan is a technological marvel, but so is the Tesla, and it is clear that Porsche has to play plenty of catch up in regards to their infotainment system, which in all fairness applies to everyone else. In addition, the Tesla's combination of unmatched range and a comprehensive charging network practically seals the deal in this world of range anxiety. And while the validity of the other numbers arguments are questionable, they cannot be avoided because as the automotive and technology industries fuse together, they possess great marketing power. The fact that Porsche’s appeal is not strongly tied to them probably suggests that they were the wrong brand for a “Tesla killer.” Nonetheless I’d imagine the Taycan would still be moderately successful, but Tesla for sure isn’t going anywhere.</p>
